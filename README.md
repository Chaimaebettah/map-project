##Neighborhood Map (responsive app)

In this project I use Google Maps API, Foursquare API,  wikipedia API,and knockout.js to create a single web application  that displays  10 different location,
each one has their own information.

The search bar can be used to filter the results by name.
Accessing more information about a location can be done by clicking on the result in the list view or clicking the marker on the map.
 
 
 
 
##How to run the project

To run the Neighborhood Map web application, open index.html in a web browser.
